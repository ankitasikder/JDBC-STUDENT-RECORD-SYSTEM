## About :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education establishments used to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts of academic achievement and co-curricular activities, and the results of student assessment scores; forming student schedules; tracking student attendance; and managing other student-related data needs in an educational institution. Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers. Student management system is an environment where all the process of the student in the institution is managed. It is done through the automated computerized method. Conventionally this system is done using papers, file and binders. This system saves the time of the student and of the administrator. It includes process like registration of the student’s details, assigning the department based on their course and maintenance of the record. This system reduces the cost and workforce required for this job. As the system is online the information is globally present to everyone. This makes the system easy to handle and feasible for finding the omission with updating at the same time. As for the existing system, they use to maintain their record manually which makes it vulnerable to security. If filed a query to search or update in a manual system, it will take a lot of time to process the query and make a report which is a tedious job. As the system used in the institute is outdated as it requires paper, files and the binders, which will require the human workforce to maintain them. To get registered in the institute, a student in this system one should come to the university. Get the forms from the counter while standing in the queue which consumes a lot of the student’s time as well as of management team. As the number of the student increases in the institute manually managing the strength becomes a hectic job for the administrator. This computerized system store all the data in the database which makes it easy to fetch and update whenever needed. We have come with this project with JDBC. We have made a connection to a database, created SQL statements, executed SQL queries in the database, viewed and modified the resulting records. JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. Before JDBC, ODBC API was the database API to connect and execute the query with the database. But, ODBC API uses ODBC driver which is written in C language (i.e. platform dependent and unsecured). That is why Java has defined its own API (JDBC API) that uses JDBC drivers (written in Java language). **Here in java environment, we can add, delete, fetch records. Here in SQL environment, we can also see records as table. We can fetch data very efficiently using this concept for deployment of this project.**
</div>

## Purpose :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
The purpose of this project is to create student database using Java Database Connectivity concept. Here we should able to operate the database using both Java and SQL. We have to retrieve records. We have to delete records according to our need. We have to be able to search a student’s record using specific idea. This makes an efficient Student Record System.
</div>

## Use :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
User has to run the project after opening it in eclipse or idea intellij. Then he has to see the menu. Accordingly he can choose options for specific tasks like adding records, deleting, searching or view records. These types of tasks can be done easily. Wrong credentials will note be taken. If same type of record for some specific cases is given then the program will not work for that. After using user can exit the program. From SQL environment also database can be accessed. This program is made with just real world idea. It is simple and efficient.
</div>

## Applications :point_down:

1. Improves the General Performance Of Students
For students to come out with good grades, the focus is highly needed. With this school administration software, students are able to use their precious time for relevant things which is studying rather than keep track of their records to make sure things are intact. Moreover, fear of losing important records to manual management is completely off the line with the help of this software.
2. It helps Simply and Streamlines All Task
As a teacher, keeping track of all the activities done by each student is never easy and inefficient. But with this student record system, teachers are able to keep track of each student work and what is yet to be done. In most software, there is a dashboard and a single screen display to make things even easier and more efficient.
3. Improved Communication
It's impossible for every student in a class to get each lesson passed across while teaching. This might be a problem on the path of the students being timid or reluctant at that point in time or insufficient time to ask questions. With the help of this software, that has been sorted out. Most online school management software now has an inbuilt discussion panel where students could easily communicate with their teachers and ask relevant questions.
4. Can Be Accessed by All Parties Involved
Gone are the days when parents know little to nothing about what their child or ward does at school. This open source school management system has made it possible for parents to have access to their children's school activities, assignments, attendance, and other relevant information just by using the software.
5. Efficient Management And Organization of Timetables
The management of a school timetable is the work of the admin department of a school. Despite being dedicated to a department, it never correlates. With this software, the reverse is the case. This student record system is able to organize school timetables in such a way that they won't be a clash of lectures. In addition to that, students, teachers, and parents have access to it.
6. Helps to Keep Track Of All Students
School activity goes beyond the wall of the classrooms. There are other activities like sports, interaction, and other extracurricular activities and all these needs proper documentation. This management software has features that see to that and make sure the record of each student is intact.
7. Reduction of Human Labour, Papers and Workload
The cost incurred from employing staff to manage the activities of a school is an additional cost that shouldn't be if you decide to make use of this new technology. With this student management system, your number of staffs, excessive buying of writing materials will be minimal and functionality will improve.
8. Provide A Means to Advice Students
The student management system has an advising module that helps facilitate student advising process. This is most effective when a particular student is having a draw down academically and advice is to be given by teachers.
9. Helps Build A Strong Alumni
There is more to life than the walls of the school. This same software has the ability to build an alumni network to help other students with job referrals. All this is made possible with the help of this software.
10. Improves the General Comfort Of Staffs
Work comfort is another factor that determines the performance of staff and this student management system have successfully put that in place. Teachers are able to manage their students in a smart way.

## Future Scopes :point_down:

1.This student record system can be deployed in a online web portal for students and teachers.
2. One can upgrade this web portal to store subject video lectures under different professor names and also maintain the previous year’s question papers in it.
3.The portal can be used to take day to day attendance and automatically send an SMS to the students and their parent.
4. One can deploy this web application into mobile android application and be used in smaller devices like mobile phones, tablets and notepads.
5. In future web portal can be combined with the university internal and external web sites. So that all courses in the university will have single web app.
6. Students can directly fill a resume forum system will use artificial intelligence and sent the resume to companies as per student requirement and eligibility criteria.
7. The present system may be further upgraded in future even maintain the activities in hostel like hostel mess bill and attendance system even in hostels.
8. By using artificial intelligence the web portal may track the usage of Wi – Fi based on the students registered device.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
Requirement analysis is a software engineering technique that is composed of the various tasks that determine the needs or conditions that are to be met for a new or altered product, taking into consideration the possible conflicting requirements of the various users.
Functional requirements are those requirements that are used to illustrate the internal working nature of the system, the description of the system, and explanation of each subsystem. It consists of what task the system should perform the process involved, which data should the system holds and the interfaces with the user. The functional requirement identified are:
a.	Adding Students:
All the required students’ details containing their name, roll number, enrolment number, registration number, phone number, city are added when we choose option 1 in menu.
b.	Displaying Whole Record:
All the added records are stored in a database and are fetched and showed when we choose option 3 in menu.
c.	Searching Particular Student Information:
We can choose option 4 when we want to search a particular student’s record. We have to give the enrolment number of that student to get that student’s details.
d.	Deleting Records:
When we want to delete a student’s record we have to choose option 2 and give that student’s id no. Then that record will be deleted.
e.	Exit Program:
If we want to exit the program we have to choose option 5. Then the program will be closed.
We have used Idea Intellij Software for java and MySql for sql.
JDBC Connectivity:
We have created a project in Idea Intellij IDE. We have created 4 java files in src folder. These are Main.java, ConnectionProvider.java, ConnectionMethods.java, Student.java. 
We have successfully established a connection with the relation database model with ‘ConnectionProvider.java’ and created a new database called “students_record” using mysql .With the specified root route and in the specified location (here localhost ) with particular username and password we have established a smooth connection with our java project. Handling records and searching for them becomes easier which such database management system.
 We used a table “students” in our database and created an array “enrolls[]” in order to check if multiple records of same enrolment number  of student are being entered the entry is being declined showing that the above enrolment number has been entered previously. 
We created an array “rgnos[]” in order to check if multiple records of same registration number of student are being entered the entry is being declined showing that the above registration number has been entered previously.
Such error handling, easy searching and safer security of storing data is only being established with the help of this Java Database Connectivity.
A JAR is a package file format was included in order to provide the connectivity of our database , typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources into one file for distribution. JAR files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file. They are built on the ZIP format and typically have a .jar file extension.
Non-functional requirements:
It describes aspects of the system that are concerned with how the system provides the functional requirements. They are:
a.	Security:
The subsystem should provide a high level of security and integrity of the data held by the system, only authorized personnel of the system can gain access to the system’s secured page on the system.
b.	Performance and Response Time:
The system should have high performance rate when executing user’s input and should be able to provide the response within a short time span usually seconds for highly complicated task and 20 to 25 seconds for less complicated task.
c.	Error handling:
Error should be considerably minimized and an appropriate error message that guides the user to recover from an error should be provided. Validation of user’s input is highly essential. Also the standard time taken to recover from an error should be 15 to 20 seconds.
d.	Availability: 
This system should always be available for access at 24 hours, 7 days a week. Also in the occurrence of any major system malfunctioning, the system should be available in 1 to 2 working days, so that the business process is not severely affected.
e.	Ease of use:
Considered the level of knowledge possessed by the user of this system, a simple but quality user interface should be developed to make it easy to understand and required less training.
